*Congratulations!*

When you are reading this you have found the documentation. 
This documentation is a community effort. Therefore we will give a quick intro onto how to write documentation. 

But first a few  disclaimers:

NOTE: The header row is currently a placeholder until one of us learns enough html/css to fix it

NOTE: A mini TOC on the right will also be rendered after we learn more html/css

NOTE: The search bar is currently disabled since it is not working yet (But neither is the one of confluence)

NOTE: The edit this page button does not show up. It really should. And sometimes it does. Also: Works on my machine when building the documentation for preview :)
